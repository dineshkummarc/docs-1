# Project Liike: Document Repository

The purpose of this repo is to post draft topics to get feedback on them. Here are some questions we would love the answer to:

* What is missing in a particular topic?
* What parts of the topic do you find the most helpful?
* Is there a better way to communicate a specific idea?
* What can we do to improve the graphics/diagrams?
* Can we do anything to make the guidance more actionable?

We would like to invite you to take a look at these docs and share your thoughts about them. Feel free to create a new issue or add a comment to an existing one.

If there is enough demand, we may consider making these documents available in other formats (HTML, Markdown, etc), but for now we're using Microsoft Word since this format fits best into our workflow and tools.

We appreciate your help and looking forward to hearing from you.
